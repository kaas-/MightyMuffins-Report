\chapter{Testing Interview Script}\label{app:interviewscript}
Hello and thank you for wanting to participate in this test. We are group 30.

Our prototype takes an image and turns it into a sound. During this test we will give you a few different assignments and ask you questions during the test. This is a test of the product, and we prefer you to think out loud during the test.
