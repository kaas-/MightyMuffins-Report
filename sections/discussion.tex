What can this be used for?

Two extra sliders to control the picture.
It would be possible to alter the function of the project, such that the user would have the possibility to decide where in the picture the program should be looking, as this would allow the user further freedom over the creation of sound, made by the product. But if it wasn't implemented correct, it would add to the confusion of the user, due to the amount of extra components on the interface.


Sliders change the picture. 


Instead of picture, use a video feed.


Mobile edition.


User able to upload sound or picture.
