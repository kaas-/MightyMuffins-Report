Sonic photo is a program that allows the user to transform an image into sound by loading an image into the program, from where various parameters can be modified to alter the image and sound. 

It's possible to alter the frequency(Hz), brightness, tone, and the harmony quantization. 

through the use of the instrument and harmony quantization it's possible to alter the sound which the picture produces. 
You can decide what harmonics and chords you want to use. 
it's also possible to alter the harmonics brightness, the strength of the quantization and the base pitch that the picture produces.
