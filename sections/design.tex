\chapter{Design}\label{ch:design}
\todo{This part needs rework. Write after chapter is done.}
This chapter will cover the design iterations and the decisions that were made. 

\section{Initial brainstorm}
The initial brainstorm consists of two brainstorms that was chained together. The starting point of the first brainstorm was the point "Image to sound" and the second brainstorms starting point was "Filters". All the points from "Image to sound" 
\todo{write the "image to sound" points pls}

The points expanding from "Filters" relates to tools the user can apply to the audio created from the image. "Filters" branches out to the point called "Different Filters" which lists all the differnt common filters that may be applied to the audio. It also branches out to the point called "Equalisers" \todo{glossary} which inspired "Controls" that leads to the different possibilities for controlling the filters applied on the image created audio.


\section{Conceptual model}
\todo{her er foretaget nogle valg inden dette afsnit, som skal beskrives}This project will work with audiolisation of image. The initial design is focused on the conversion of images into an audio signal. \todo{beskriv gerne mere i dybden}Each pixel has an intensity value which can be converted into a range that fits the human hearing of 20 to 20.000Hz (insert refrence). The output of this operation can then be manipulated by audio processing filters (insert refrence).

The concept includes a control interface in the artefact. It allows the user to have control over the output in real time, as the control interface will change how the filter effect will modify the image-created audio. This gives the user agency of how the output will sound. To allow the user to create even more unique sounds, multiple filter can be applied simultaneously. This allows for a wide range of artistic expression, as the user will have control over the audio output.

\section{Peripheral devices}
The user has to be able to affect the audio that the image generates by interacting with a physical interface. The system will apply an effect which can be modified through a physical scalar which changes the variable range of the power of the effect from 0\% to 100\%, or in numbers 0 to 1. For this interface these different variations of a physical scalar has been considered: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Button
\item Pressure sensor
\item Ultra sonic distance sensor
\item Potentiometer
\item Slider
\item Bend sensor
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Axis}
\caption{\label{fig:axis}}
\end{figure}

Each of these peripheral devices makes the user interact with the prototype differently and changes what functionality can be implemented.

Figure \ref{fig:axis} shows the scales of which the different devices operate on, how many different axis they are able to manipulate, and to what length.
 
The button can be clicked as its only functionality. The button have two states: low and high. The low state is when the button is not clicked, and the high state is when the button is being clicked. \todo{tja, den giver et spark til whatever ligger bagved, hvor det bagved kunne sagtens være randomomised}This means that a system using a button will have programmed states, which will be cycled through in a predetermined direction.

Variable resistors allow a system to have a position between the two extremes of low and high. This allows the system to have more fluid control than a simple binary choice of on or off.

There are multiple variable resistors to choose from, depending on how the user would interact with the given device, as they all function is a fundamentally similar way. Pressure sensors react aptly to being pressured, such as from touch and pushing. More pressure equals to a higher position on the scale.
Ultra sonic distance sensor measures distance between the sensor and a hard surface in front of the sensor. The closer the hard surface is to the sensor's front, the higher the state.
Potentiometers are adjustable by turning a part of it between a minimum and maximum position. Depending on how much the potentiometer is turned will result in the scale output from the device. Turning knobs is an example of potentiometers in daily use.
A slider is a variant of a potentiometer, with a linear interface instead of a rotary one.
Unlike the previously mentioned variable resistors that all have a clear low and high state, the bend sensor functions differently. The bend sensor rests at a mid-point between low and high. Depending on which direction the sensor is bent the resistance will either go up or down.

The way that these devices would be used are as variable controller for the effect itself. Depending on what device is chosen, the integration for the user will be different. This will be tested in the iterations of the prototype and discussed further to make sure that the interface is user-friendly and easy to understand.

\section{Early sketches and testing}
While sketching ideas for the design, the group encountered the obstacle of not knowing which electrical components to use. Therefore the component test's purpose was to decide which component is the most intuitive to use. All the !previous mentioned! electronic components were used in the test, though there was two different buttons and 3 differnt potentiometers.
These components were all mounted on a cardboard plate as seen on the figure below.

!!insert figure of pap thing og beskriv det!!

The test was conducted on 10 participants, all fellow students from Medialogy. The participants were explain by test facilitator 1 how each component worked and how to interact with them. They were told that they had to use all of the components one at a time in a numeral order and think out loud when using the components. Test facilitator 2 turned the volume of the music up and down, corresponding to how much the participant !!turned/clicked/slid/moved their hand!!.

Results showed that the participants preferred using the slider, showed on the figure below, when changing the volume of the music. New design sketches were created based on this result.

\section{The chosen sketch}
Hej Knud. Se venligst bort fra dette afsnit
Forklar i details om sketchen, hvorfor vi valgte den og indsæt state diagrammet

\section{Interface low-fi test}
The chosen sketch was made into a paper mock-up to test the \todo{ind i glossary med dig} percieved affordance and the \todo{dette kan betyde forskellige ting i forskellige sammenhænge} feedforward. Since it was a paper mock-up, no electronic components were used. What should have been the audio feedback was replaced with an drawing of a light bulb in order for understanding the intention of changing the intensity of an object. 

The mock-up was tested on 6 fellow Medialogy students. Test facilitator 1 explained how the interface worked and asked the participant to execute the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Turn on the device
\item Turn on slider 1
\item Change the intensity of the illumination of light bulb 1
\item Turn on slider 2
\item Change the intensity of the illumination of light bulb 2
\item Turn on both sliders
\item Change the intensity of both or individually both light bulbs
\item Turn off the device
\end{itemize}

\todo{beskrive neutrale states}

Results showed that it was clear that to the user that he/she had to use the slider to change the intensity of the light bulb. However, switching between the states of which slider was in use, proved to be difficult for the user since their perception the feedforward was not clear enough. Some users suggested the use of imagery for better understanding of the interface.
Since the feedforward of the slider was not sufficient enough, a feedforward test was conducted.

\section{Feedforward test}
Eight different designs for the slider was made, as can be seen on the figure below.

!insert image of slider!

The participants for this test were also from the Medialogy studies. The test included 46 participants. The participants were explained the context of use !for the slider! and after asked to choose one of the eight different designs that they thought had the best feedforward. The participants were all sitting in their group areas, so to ensure the participants answers were not affect each others, they were asked to point at a piece of paper with numbers, representing the different designs, randomly located on the paper to further ensure confidentiality when telling the test facilitator what their answers were. 

!insert figure with numbers of answers!

Statistically speaking, the most preferred feedforward design was the fifth design with "MIN" and "MAX" written on it had 15 votes while the third feedforward design with the "Amplitude Bar" \todo{definer} received 14 votes. The fourth design with the values "0\%" percent "100\%" percent had the third highest amount of votes being nine out of 46 and the least favourite designs were the seventh with 3 votes and the first and second design with 2 votes each and the sixth design with only one vote. 

Even though the third and fifth feedforward design received almost the same amount of votes, the design team choose to go with the fifth design. The prototype will be expanded of this design and it will be taken into further iterations of the performance testing.
