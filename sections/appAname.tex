Hello and thank you for wanting to participate in this test. We are group 30.

Our prototype takes an image and turns it into a sound. During this test we will give you a few different assignments and ask you questions during the test. This is a test of the product, and we prefer you to think out loud during the test.

Questions: 


\begin{itemize}
\item What do you think you have to do with this product?
\item What happens when you manipulated with the sliders?
\item Can you hear a difference between “MIN” and “MAX”?

\item Is the “help text” helpfull to you?
\end{itemize}
