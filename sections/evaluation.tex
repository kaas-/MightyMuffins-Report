\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:evaluation}

This chapter explains and describes the setup for the test, the procedure of the interview and results of the evaluation of the final prototype. 

\section{Technical test}
To ensure that the used filters work as intended, the frequency responses of the filters were plotted. These were then compared to expected outcomes to determine whether they work as intended. All frequency response curves can be seen Appendix \ref{app:frequencyresponse}

When testing the comb filter, the delay was adjusted to see if the frequency response changed appropriately. In all cases, the frequency response of the filter has a very distinct shape, with multiple sharp peaks and concave valleys in succession. This shape is very reminiscent of an upside-down comb, which is exactly what is desired of the frequency response of a comb filter.

When testing the bandpass filter, two phases of testing were conducted. First, a static centre frequency was held, while the bandwidth of the filter was adjusted. Last, the bandwidth was held static, and the centre frequency was adjusted. When looking at the resulting curves, it is evident that when the bandwidth is low many frequencies are rejected, while letting frequencies close to the centre frequency through. When the bandwidth is high, a large range of frequencies are let through, and only the frequencies furthest away from the centre frequency are rejected. The curve also moves in the desired direction, when increasing or decreasing the centre frequency.

When testing the high-shelf filter, three phases of testing were conducted. First, the cut-off frequency was adjusted while the decibel gain and slope variable were held static. Then, the decibel gain was adjusted, while the cut-off frequency and slope variable were held static. Last, the slope variable was adjusted, while the cut-off frequency and decibel gain were held static. The high plateau of the high-shelf filter decreases in width when increasing the cut-off frequency, which means that fewer of the higher frequencies are affected. When adjusting the decibel gain, the curve has a plateau when the decibel gain is positive, and becomes more of a valley when the decibel gain becomes negative. The slope between the middle line and the shelf becomes steeper as the slope variable is increased. This matches the expected behaviour of a high-shelf filter.

Therefore, all the filters do work as intended, as indicated by their frequency responses.

\section{Usability test}

The final test was conducted on 15 test participants from Aalborg University through a semi-structured interview. The participants consisted of 14 students from Medialogy and one student from Art \& Technology. The test took place in a small secluded room located at the university. It was conducted by a test facilitator who interviewed the participants and instructed them in the various tasks they had to do, while observing the software performed optimally. During the test a secretary took notes of what the participants answered to the questions as well as how they interacted with the product.
As seen on figure \ref{fig:testsetup}, the test participant was placed in front of the product with view to a TV screen that showed the image that was being audiolised. The two audiolised images were Leonardo da Vinci's 'Mona Lisa', which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:monalisa}, and Asger Jorn's 'Trolden og Fuglene', which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:asger}. The first image to be audiolised was the 'Mona Lisa' and the second one was 'Trolden of Fuglene'. Since the software and the image that was shown on the TV screen are independent of one another, the test facilitator had to manually change the displayed image to the one that was currently being audiolised.

The test was carried out by welcoming the test participant who was asked to sign a consent form. The test facilitator started the test by introducing the overall project and explaining what the participant was expected to do during the test such as thinking out loud (the full script can be seen in Appendix \ref{app:interviewscript}). The test participant was first asked what they immediately thought they had to do when they saw the interface. After the test participants gave their answer, the test facilitator turned on the audiolisation of 'Mona Lisa' and told the participant to play around with the sliders. The next questions were about the audio of the product; whether the participants could hear a difference between 'MIN' and 'MAX' as well as the difference between the individual filters. Before the audiolisation changed to 'Trolden og Fuglene', the participants were asked if the text on the interface helped them understand the product better. After changing to the audiolisation of 'Trolden og Fuglene' the participants were asked if they could hear a difference between the two images, and again, a difference between 'MIN' and 'MAX', and a difference between the individual filters. Lastly the participants were asked to give their final thoughts.

\subsection{Evaluation results and analysis}
The Tables \ref{tab:comb}, \ref{tab:bandpass}, \ref{tab:highshelf}, \ref{tab:helptext}, and \ref{tab:twoimagedifference} show the results from the evaluation. Table \ref{tab:comb}, \ref{tab:bandpass} and \ref{tab:highshelf} have both answers from each audiolisation when asking to hear the difference between 'MIN' and 'MAX'.

For statistical analysis of quantitative data, Fisher's exact test is used to determine whether there is a connection between explanatory variables and their contingencies. This test is specifically concerned with the influence the two different images have on our results. Binomial tests are used to determine the significance of our results \cite{crawley2005statistics}. An significance value $\alpha$ of 0.05 is used.

The product must be able to audiolise the image. For this criteria to be fulfilled, individual images must produce audio that is distinct. The user test shows that images produce a unique sound. This can be seen in the fact that all test participants could hear a clear difference between the colourful Asger Jorn painting and the darker Mona Lisa painting ($p=6.104e-5$). 

The effects that are applied to this audiolisation must be alterable by the user. There is an underlying assumption to this criteria that this effect must be discernible by the user, otherwise there is no point to it. Using Fisher's exact test it is first determined whether the image has an influence on whether the user can hear the effect. There is no significant correlation between the image used and the users ability to hear the effect for any of the filters ($p_{comb}=1$, $p_{bandpass}=0.6513$, $p_{highshelf}=1$). Then it is determined whether users can hear a difference between a filter being applied or not applied. Users determined that they could hear the bandpass filter ($p=0.001431$) and the high-shelf filter ($p=1.863e-09$). They also determined they could NOT hear the comb filter ($p=8.43e-06$).

Finally the product must be usable. The interface was clear for all the participants and they knew how to use it, either by looking at the help text or at the sliders. None of the test participants had any trouble manipulating with the sliders. Nine of the participants did not know the terms of the different filters, but they could distinguish a change in the output when manipulating with the sliders. However, all users found the help text useful. This indicates that the principle of using text labels to explain certain elements of this kind of interface is sound, but that the current implementation of this is problematic. The biggest issue here is probably that the labels make use of technical language which only provides useful information for expert users.
