\chapter{Initial Problem Description}\label{ch:initproblem}
There are many forms of creative expression including, but not limited to, audio and images, which can be created using various tools. An interesting approach could be to provide creative people a new tool of expressing themselves through the use of a physical interface of a device which can transform a digital image into audio. This project aims to explore the creation of audio from images as a tool for such creative expression.
\section{Initial Problem Statement}\label{inistatement}

How can audio be created from an image and then be manipulated through a physical interface? 

\subsection{Research Questions}\label{resquestions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which audio manipulating methods can be used to convert an image into audio?
