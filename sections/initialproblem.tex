\chapter{Initial Problem Description}\label{ch:initproblem}
An artistic expression is used by artists to express themselves through many different means, such as audio or images. Both are artistically expressed through surprising and yet unseen ways of illustrating the ability to be creative. An interesting approach of  illustrating an image may be through audio. This may provide artists a new tool of expressing themselves given by a physical interface design which can transform pixels of an image into audio. This leads to our initial problem statement.

\section{Initial Problem Statement}\label{inistatement}

How can audio be created from an image and followingly be manipulated by a physical interface? 

\subsection{Research Questions}\label{resquestions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which audio manipulating methods can be used to convert an image into audio?
\item Which physical apparatus can be used to manipulate audio?
