\section{Interface test}\label{sec:interface}
A test is conducted on the interface which the project implements. The test consist of a small circuit with a loud speaker connected to various peripheral devices.
The users feedback, is used to determine what peripheral device will be included in the project artefact. 
The test is conducted in the following matter:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Give the user context
\item How do you interact with the different devices?
\item Which are you most comfortable with?
\end{enumerate}
All the responses from the users is noted down by an interviewer, who also asks follow-up questions based on the answers given by the users. 

The test is going to be a semi structured interview, to get the most feedback from the user on which device they find the most interactive and intuitive to use.
