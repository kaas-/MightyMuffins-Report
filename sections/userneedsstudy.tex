\chapter{User Needs in Context Study}\label{ch:userstudy}

\section{User group}\label{sec:user}
The user group for this project are creative people of all ages and gender, as creativity does not have a certain age nor gender. 
The project is aiming towards creating an creative tool to be used for inspiration. 

\section{Interface test}\label{sec:interface}
A test is going to be conducted on the interface which is going to be implemented. The test is going to be a small circuit with a loud speaker connect to various peripheral devices.
The users feedback, will help determined what peripheral device will be used as the final device for the project. 
The test will be conducted in the following matter:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Give the user context
\item How do you interact with the different devices?
\item Which are you most comfortable with?
\end{enumerate}
All the responses from the users will be noted down by a note taker, who will also be asking follow up questions based on the answers given by the users. 

The test is going to be a semi structured interview, (meaning that we are going to have a script which we follow, but at the same time, we are allowed to stray off the scrip to follow up on some of the answers that is given to use by the user) to get the most feedback from the user on which device they find the most interactive and easiest to use.
