\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
The purpose of this project is to create an experimental system for audiolisation of images. This will be used as an innovative tool for everyone with artistic interest in creating new representations of visual perception. The report describes other prototypes used for audiolisation of static images and relevant audio software as well as relevant methods used in audio processing. This leads to a series of success criteria which are for evaluation. Through an iterative design process, which includes intermediate user tests, a prototype is developed and tested. The results of these tests are analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods, and then used to conclude on the prototype's performance.
