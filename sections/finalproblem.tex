\chapter{Final Problem Statement}\label{ch:finalproblem}
\todo{write a paragraph that will summaries the points that made us come to this problem statement, and the gap we will investigate}

The user group for this project are creative people of all ages and gender, as creativity is not limited by age nor gender. The project is aiming towards creating a creative tool to be used as an additional method of expression. 
The final problems statement for this project is as following:


\textit{How can an interface be applied to a real-time audiolisation of an image that enables control of filters in a user-friendly manner}


In order to fulfill the final problem statement there needs to be established some success criteria which can be validated through testing of the prototype. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user has to be able to alter the audio effect
\item The image has to be audiolised 
\item The usability has to be above 80 percent
\end{enumerate}

To obtain a successful prototype, the problem formulation has to be answered as well as the success criteria has to be fulfilled. It is therefore important that the prototype can convert an image into a sound, for then enabling the possibility to apply audio filters which the user can alter through a physical interface. The usability has to be over 80\% in order to ensure an adequate understanding of the interface. The usability will be tested with a satisfaction test using a Likert scale.
